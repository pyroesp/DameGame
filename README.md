Let's try making a Game Boy emulator

This is inspired by watching and trying to help [Daroou2](https://www.twitch.tv/daroou2 "twitch") aka [amaiorano](https://github.com/amaiorano "GitHub") on twitch with his [Vectrex emulator: vectrexy](https://github.com/amaiorano/vectrexy), and [ferrisstreamsstuff](https://www.twitch.tv/ferrisstreamsstuff "twitch") aka [yupferris](https://github.com/yupferris) with his [Virtual Boy Emulator: RustualBoy](https://github.com/emu-rs/rustual-boy).

### First commit

I wanted to have a repo with a working program, so I've been programming for a bit before commiting.
This means that the first commit can already be compiled without warning.

As of the first commit the code can already be used to test the instructions of the CPU.
