Let's try making a Game Boy emulator

This is inspired by watching and trying to help [Daroou2](https://www.twitch.tv/daroou2 "twitch") aka [amaiorano](https://github.com/amaiorano "GitHub") on twitch with his [Vectrex emulator: vectrexy](https://github.com/amaiorano/vectrexy), and [ferrisstreamsstuff](https://www.twitch.tv/ferrisstreamsstuff "twitch") aka [yupferris](https://github.com/yupferris) with his [Virtual Boy Emulator: RustualBoy](https://github.com/emu-rs/rustual-boy).
